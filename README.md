# SOARCE demo
## But WHY?!
Well, we want to demo the capabilities of SOARCE without the need of already having an application
to integrate it into. So this application does not have any real-world usecase behind it,
we're actually deliberately using a nonsense approach to have multiple services where one
usually wouldn't. You can call it even a parody. ;)

## Setup
Just run `docker-compose up` and wait a while until it runs, then point your browser to
http://localhost:8110/ to get to the billing application.

## Use
You will have to run and configure the SOARCE application as well. Clicking through the
billing application with an active usecase will generate coverage and trace data.
