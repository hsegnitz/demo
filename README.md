# SOARCE demo
## But WHY?!
Well, we want to demo the capabilities of SOARCE without the need of already having an application
to integrate it into. So this is application does not have any real-world usecase behind it,
we're actually deliberately using a nonsense approach to have multiple services where one
usually wouldn't. You can call it even a parody or cabaret. ;)

## Setup
Just run `docker-compose up` and wait a while until it runs, point soarce-demo.local in your
/etc/hosts file to the billing_application
